## Owner
mosuke5([@mosuke5](https://twitter.com/mosuke5)) owns this blog.
Currently, I mainly consult on Kubernetes and DevOps at Red Hat.
In the past, I was involved in systems engineering and public cloud management. The following is a simplified version. For detailed background information, please refer to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosuke5).

1. 2011-2013 Web application development (as a student)
1. 2013-2016 Development and operation of monitoring systems for mobile networks at SoftBank
1. 2016-2019 Launch and operation of Japan region for Alibaba Cloud
1. 2019-now Supporting the implementation of Kubernetes and DevOps, related technologies at Red Hat

I like to play tennis, watch professional tennis matches, play Pokemon, hand-drip coffee, and invest.
I have been watching professional tennis since 2005 and have become quite familiar with the game. I am also a competitive Pokémon player and carefully select my Pokémon games. During the Covid-19 period, I started to enjoy hand-drip coffee.

## Philosophy
Since around 2016, I have been working to help people utilize Kubernetes and the cloud native technologies.
I strongly feel that real world problems are often not as simple as just deploying tools to make things better.
What I feel is important is that the implementation of Kubernetes or cloud services, for example, can simultaneously create a skill set and mindset that allows for proper understanding and use, continuous growth, and the fostering of a culture.
For this reason, I try to provide not only technical support, but also support for the softer side of human nature.

I also believe that "people/organizations continue to learn" is the most important thing in this fast-flowing world today, and I am interested in ways to help people learn better.
One of the things I do is also evangelize about the benefits and learning of writing a tech blog.
Through this blog, I hope that I understand and transmit not only small techniques, but also more essential things, and I hope that people who read this blog will also get something out of it.


## About this site
This blog, "Goldstine lab", has been operating in Japanese since February 2014; starting July 2022, we have decided to release some articles in English.
As an engineer, I started it as a reminder of what I have done, and I hope that my knowledge will be useful to others.
